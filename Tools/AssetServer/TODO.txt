[ ] Read the relative location of the assets directory from config.
[x] Introduce a default config values file.
[ ] Create a filesystem access shim around fs package calls.
[ ] Change the functionality to be reusable and dynamic, instead of hardcoded for specific assets.
[x] Create a TS data model that can be leveraged to validate assets against the schema (ideally as its own project that can be consumed and updated via npm).
[ ] Ensure the data is sent back with the correct MIME type.
[ ] Change to be a general "data" server, instead of just assets (i.e. rename the app).
[ ] Make it so that all tools can be started from one command and integrate seamlessly (will likely need to publish each tool via npm so that it can be consumed by the dependent tools).
[ ] Refactor reading config out into a separate file (with strong typing, validation, and the like).
[ ] Move the schema data model into its own project.
[ ] The data model project should generate a JSON schema from the TS source that can be strongly referenced from the JSON data files.
[ ] Investigate whether woutervh-/typescript-is, YousefED/typescript-json-schema, and/or ajv-validator/ajv could benefit this project.
